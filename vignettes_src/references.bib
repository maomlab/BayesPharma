  abstract  = "ABSTRACTOne of the core problems of modern statistics is to
               approximate difficult-to-compute probability densities. This
               problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which
               frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation
               involving the posterior density. In this article, we review
               variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that
               approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has
               been used in many applications and tends to be faster than
               classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling.
               The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and
               then to find a member of that family which is close to the
               target density. Closeness is measured by Kullback?Leibler
               divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational
               inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential
               family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of
               Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic
               optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern
               research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is
               powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing
               this article is to catalyze statistical research on this class

  abstract = "High-throughput screening (HTS) has been widely used to identify
              active compounds (hits) that bind to biological targets. Because
              of cost concerns, the comprehensive screening of millions of
              compounds is typically conducted without replication. Real hits
              that fail to exhibit measurable activity in the primary screen
              due to random experimental errors will be lost as
              false-negatives. Conceivably, the projected false-negative rate
              is a parameter that reflects screening quality. Furthermore, it
              can be used to guide the selection of optimal numbers of
              compounds for hit confirmation. Therefore, a method that predicts
              false-negative rates from the primary screening data is extremely
              valuable. In this article, we describe the implementation of a

  abstract = "Examining enzyme kinetics is critical for understanding cellular
              systems and for using enzymes in industry. The Michaelis-Menten
              equation has been widely used for over a century to estimate the
              enzyme kinetic parameters from reaction progress curves of
              substrates, which is known as the progress curve assay. However,
              this canonical approach works in limited conditions, such as when
              there is a large excess of substrate over enzyme. Even when this
              condition is satisfied, the identifiability of parameters is not
              always guaranteed, and often not verifiable in practice. To
              overcome such limitations of the canonical approach for the
              progress curve assay, here we propose a Bayesian approach based
              on an equation derived with the total quasi-steady-state
              approximation. In contrast to the canonical approach, estimates
              obtained with this proposed approach exhibit little bias for any
              combination of enzyme and substrate concentrations. Importantly,
              unlike the canonical approach, an optimal experiment to identify
              parameters with certainty can be easily designed without any
              prior information. Indeed, with this proposed design, the kinetic
              parameters of diverse enzymes with disparate catalytic
              efficiencies, such as chymotrypsin, fumarase, and urease, can be
              accurately and precisely estimated from a minimal amount of
              timecourse data. A publicly accessible computational package

              libraries. We therefore developed multi-dimensional synergy of
              combinations (MuSyC), a formalism based on a generalized,

              circuits underlying many neurobehavioral disorders. KOR agonists
              directly inhibit ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic
              neurons, contributing to aversive responses (Margolis et al.
              2003, 2006); therefore, selective KOR antagonists represent a
              novel therapeutic approach to restore circuit function. We used
              whole cell electrophysiology in acute rat midbrain slices to
              evaluate pharmacological properties of four novel KOR

              BTRX-335140 and BTRX-395750 fully blocked U-69,593 currents (IC50
              = 1.2 $\pm$ 0.9 and 1.2 $\pm$ 1.3 nM, respectively). JNJ-67953964
              showed an IC50 of 3.0 $\pm$ 4.6 nM. PF-04455242 exhibited partial
              antagonist activity asymptoting at 55\% blockade (IC50 = 6.7
              $\pm$ 15.1 nM). In 3/8 of neurons, 1 $\mu$M PF-04455242 generated
              an outward current independent of KOR activation. BTRX-335140 (10
              nM) did not affect responses to saturating concentrations of the
              mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonist DAMGO or the delta opioid
              receptor (DOR) agonist DPDPE, while JNJ-67953964 (10 nM)
              partially blocked DAMGO and DPDPE responses. Importantly,
              BTRX-335140 (10 nM) rapidly washed out with complete recovery of
              U-69,593 responses within 10 min. Collectively, we show

              antagonists that could impact their therapeutic potential and

              characterized by excessive accumulation of phospholipids. Its
              cellular mechanism is still not well understood, but it is known
              that cationic amphiphilic drugs can induce it. These drugs have a
              hydrophilic amine head group that can be protonated in the
              endolysosomal compartment. As cationic amphiphiles, they are
              trapped in lysosomes, where they interfere with negatively
              charged intralysosomal vesicles, the major platforms of cellular
              sphingolipid degradation. Metabolic principles observed in
              sphingolipid and phospholipid catabolism and inherited
              sphingolipidoses are of great importance for lysosomal function
              and physiological lipid turnover at large. Therefore, we also
              propose intralysosomal vesicles as major platforms for
              degradation of lipids and phospholipids reaching them by
              intracellular pathways like autophagy and endocytosis.
              Phospholipids are catabolized as components of vesicle surfaces
              by protonated, positively charged phospholipases,
              electrostatically attracted to the negatively charged vesicles.
              Model experiments suggest that progressively accumulating
              cationic amphiphilic drugs inserting into the vesicle membrane
              with their hydrophobic molecular moieties disturb and attenuate
              the main mechanism of lipid degradation as discussed here. By
              compensating the negative surface charge, cationic enzymes are
              released from the surface of vesicles and proteolytically
              degraded, triggering a progressive lipid storage and the
              formation of inactive lamellar bodies.",

               Stan builds readers' knowledge of and confidence in statistical
               modeling. Reflecting the need for even minor programming in
               today's model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to
               perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated.
               This unique computational approach ensures that readers
               understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and
               interpretations in their own modeling work. The text presents
               generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian
               perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of
               Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the
               basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also
               discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process
               models for spatial and network autocorrelation. By using
               complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a
               practical foundation for performing statistical inference.
               Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the
               natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced
               or specialized statistical modeling. Web ResourceThe book is
               accompanied by an R package (rethinking) that is available on
               the author's website and GitHub. The two core functions (map and
               map2stan) of this package allow a variety of statistical models
               to be constructed from standard model formulas.",

                   Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to
                   specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us
                   with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and
                   using these models, along with many remaining challenges in
                   computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world
                   problems requires not only statistical skills, subject
                   matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the
                   decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these
                   aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of
                   applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow
                   also includes iterative model building, model checking,
                   validation and troubleshooting of computational problems,
                   model understanding, and model comparison. We review all
                   these aspects of workflow in the context of several

                   fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a

               iterative simulation methods are potentially very helpful for
               summarizing multivariate distributions. Used naively, however,
               iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods
               are simple and generally applicable to the output of any
               iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers
               primarily interested in the science underlying the data and
               models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers
               interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative
               simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use
               several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from
               an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative
               simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest,
               a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper
               the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were
               continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied
               inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems,
               which often tend toward normality after transformations and
               marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory
               approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the
               observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a
               random-effects mixture model applied to experimental

               probabilistic machine learning, but successful probabilistic
               programming systems require flexible, generic and efficient
               inference engines. In this work, we present a system called
               Turing for building MCMC algorithms for probabilistic
               programming inference. Turing has a very simple syntax and makes
               full use of the numerical capabilities in the Julia programming
               language, including all implemented probability distributions,
               and automatic differentiation. Turing supports a wide range of
               popular Monte Carlo algorithms, including Hamiltonian Monte
               Carlo (HMC), HMC with No-U-Turns (NUTS), Gibbs sampling,
               sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), and several particle MCMC (PMCMC)
               samplers. Most importantly, Turing inference is composable: it
               combines MCMC operations on subsets of variables, for example
               using a combination of an HMC engine and a particle Gibbs (PG)
               engine. We explore several combinations of inference methods
               with the aim of finding approaches that are both efficient and
               universal, i.e. applicable to arbitrary probabilistic models.
               NUTS---a popular variant of HMC that adapts Hamiltonian
               simulation path length automatically, although quite powerful
               for exploring differentiable target distributions, is however
               not universal. We identify some failure modes for the NUTS
               engine, and demonstrate that composition of PG (for discrete
               variables) and NUTS (for continuous variables) can be useful
               when the NUTS engine is either not applicable, or simply does
               not work well. Our aim is to present Turing and its composable
               inference engines to the world and encourage other researchers

              statistics, our personal experience has led us to believe that
              naively applying Bayesian methods can be dangerous for at least 3
              main reasons: the potential influence of priors,
              misinterpretation of Bayesian features and results, and improper
              reporting of Bayesian results. To deal with these 3 points of
              potential danger, we have developed a succinct checklist: the
              WAMBS-checklist (When to worry and how to Avoid the Misuse of
              Bayesian Statistics). The purpose of the questionnaire is to
              describe 10 main points that should be thoroughly checked when
              applying Bayesian analysis. We provide an account of ``when to
              worry'' for each of these issues related to: (a) issues to check
              before estimating the model, (b) issues to check after estimating
              the model but before interpreting results, (c) understanding the
              influence of priors, and (d) actions to take after interpreting
              results. To accompany these key points of concern, we will
              present diagnostic tools that can be used in conjunction with the
              development and assessment of a Bayesian model. We also include
              examples of how to interpret results when ``problems'' in
              estimation arise, as well as syntax and instructions for
              implementation. Our aim is to stress the importance of openness
              and transparency of all aspects of Bayesian estimation, and it is
              our hope that the WAMBS questionnaire can aid in this process.

               conference was held, with the primary objective to stimulate the
               practical implementation of Bayesian statistics, and to promote
               the added-value for accelerating the discovery and the delivery
               of new cures to patients. This book is a synthesis of the

               methods applied to nearly all stages of research and
               development, from early discovery to portfolio management. It

              well suited for the use of Bayesian statistical approaches that

  abstract  = "Successful pharmaceutical drug development requires finding
               correct doses. The issues that conventional dose-response
               analyses consider, namely whether responses are related to
               doses, which doses have responses differing from a control dose
               response, the functional form of a dose-response relationship,
               and the dose(s) to carry forward, do not need to be addressed
               simultaneously. Determining if a dose-response relationship
               exists, regardless of its functional form, and then identifying
               a range of doses to study further may be a more efficient
               strategy. This article describes a novel estimation-focused
               Bayesian approach (BMA-Mod) for carrying out the analyses when

               that marks proteins for degradation in a highly specific manner.
               During screening, PROTAC compounds are tested in
               concentration?response (CR) assays to determine their potency,
               and parameters such as the half-maximal degradation
               concentration (DC50) are estimated from the fitted CR curves.
               These parameters are used to rank compounds, with lower DC50
               values indicating greater potency. However, PROTAC data often
               exhibit biphasic and polyphasic relationships, making standard
               sigmoidal CR models inappropriate. A common solution includes
               manual omitting of points (the so-called masking step), allowing
               standard models to be used on the reduced data sets. Due to its
               manual and subjective nature, masking becomes a costly and
               nonreproducible procedure. We therefore used a Bayesian
               changepoint Gaussian processes model that can flexibly fit both
               nonsigmoidal and sigmoidal CR curves without user input.
               Parameters such as the DC50, maximum effect Dmax, and point of
               departure (PoD) are estimated from the fitted curves. We then
               rank compounds based on one or more parameters and propagate the
               parameter uncertainty into the rankings, enabling us to
               confidently state if one compound is better than another. Hence,
               we used a flexible and automated procedure for PROTAC screening
               experiments. By minimizing subjective decisions, our approach
               reduces time and cost and ensures reproducibility of the
               compound-ranking procedure. The code and data are provided on

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
              (SARS-CoV-2) infection and the resulting coronavirus disease 2019
              (Covid-19) have afflicted tens of millions of people in a
              worldwide pandemic. Safe and effective vaccines are needed
              urgently. METHODS: In an ongoing multinational,
              placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we
              randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio
              to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the
              BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 $\mu$g per dose). BNT162b2 is a
              lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine
              that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2
              full-length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy
              of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety.
              RESULTS: A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization,
              of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and
              21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at
              least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to
              receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo;
              BNT162b2 was 95\% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95\% credible
              interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90
              to 100\%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex,
              race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of
              coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with
              onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and
              1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was
              characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the
              injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious
              adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo
              groups. CONCLUSIONS: A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred
              95\% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or
              older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of
              other viral vaccines. (Funded by BioNTech and Pfizer;
