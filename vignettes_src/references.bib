  abstract = "Examining enzyme kinetics is critical for understanding cellular
              systems and for using enzymes in industry. The Michaelis-Menten
              equation has been widely used for over a century to estimate the
              enzyme kinetic parameters from reaction progress curves of
              substrates, which is known as the progress curve assay. However,
              this canonical approach works in limited conditions, such as when
              there is a large excess of substrate over enzyme. Even when this
              condition is satisfied, the identifiability of parameters is not
              always guaranteed, and often not verifiable in practice. To
              overcome such limitations of the canonical approach for the
              progress curve assay, here we propose a Bayesian approach based
              on an equation derived with the total quasi-steady-state
              approximation. In contrast to the canonical approach, estimates
              obtained with this proposed approach exhibit little bias for any
              combination of enzyme and substrate concentrations. Importantly,
              unlike the canonical approach, an optimal experiment to identify
              parameters with certainty can be easily designed without any
              prior information. Indeed, with this proposed design, the kinetic
              parameters of diverse enzymes with disparate catalytic
              efficiencies, such as chymotrypsin, fumarase, and urease, can be
              accurately and precisely estimated from a minimal amount of
              timecourse data. A publicly accessible computational package
              performing such accurate and efficient Bayesian inference for
              enzyme kinetics is provided.",

              reduce off-target toxicity by minimizing doses (synergistic
              potency) and improve outcomes by escalating effect (synergistic
              efficacy). Established drug synergy frameworks obscure such
              distinction, failing to harness the potential of modern chemical
              libraries. We therefore developed multi-dimensional synergy of
              combinations (MuSyC), a formalism based on a generalized,
              multi-dimensional Hill equation, which decouples synergistic
              potency and efficacy. In mutant-EGFR-driven lung cancer, MuSyC
              reveals that combining a mutant-EGFR inhibitor with inhibitors of
              other kinases may result only in synergistic potency, whereas
              synergistic efficacy can be achieved by co-targeting mutant-EGFR
              and epigenetic regulation or microtubule polymerization. In
              mutant-BRAF melanoma, MuSyC determines whether a molecular
              correlate of BRAFi insensitivity alters a BRAF inhibitor's
              potency, efficacy, or both. These findings showcase MuSyC's
              potential to transform the enterprise of drug-combination screens

              circuits underlying many neurobehavioral disorders. KOR agonists
              directly inhibit ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopaminergic
              neurons, contributing to aversive responses (Margolis et al.
              2003, 2006); therefore, selective KOR antagonists represent a
              novel therapeutic approach to restore circuit function. We used
              whole cell electrophysiology in acute rat midbrain slices to
              evaluate pharmacological properties of four novel KOR

              outward current induced by the KOR selective agonist U-69,593.
              BTRX-335140 and BTRX-395750 fully blocked U-69,593 currents (IC50
              = 1.2 $\pm$ 0.9 and 1.2 $\pm$ 1.3 nM, respectively). JNJ-67953964
              showed an IC50 of 3.0 $\pm$ 4.6 nM. PF-04455242 exhibited partial
              antagonist activity asymptoting at 55\% blockade (IC50 = 6.7
              $\pm$ 15.1 nM). In 3/8 of neurons, 1 $\mu$M PF-04455242 generated
              an outward current independent of KOR activation. BTRX-335140 (10
              nM) did not affect responses to saturating concentrations of the
              mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonist DAMGO or the delta opioid
              receptor (DOR) agonist DPDPE, while JNJ-67953964 (10 nM)
              partially blocked DAMGO and DPDPE responses. Importantly,
              BTRX-335140 (10 nM) rapidly washed out with complete recovery of
              U-69,593 responses within 10 min. Collectively, we show

              antagonists that could impact their therapeutic potential and

              characterized by excessive accumulation of phospholipids. Its
              cellular mechanism is still not well understood, but it is known
              that cationic amphiphilic drugs can induce it. These drugs have a
              hydrophilic amine head group that can be protonated in the
              endolysosomal compartment. As cationic amphiphiles, they are
              trapped in lysosomes, where they interfere with negatively
              charged intralysosomal vesicles, the major platforms of cellular
              sphingolipid degradation. Metabolic principles observed in
              sphingolipid and phospholipid catabolism and inherited
              sphingolipidoses are of great importance for lysosomal function
              and physiological lipid turnover at large. Therefore, we also
              propose intralysosomal vesicles as major platforms for
              degradation of lipids and phospholipids reaching them by
              intracellular pathways like autophagy and endocytosis.
              Phospholipids are catabolized as components of vesicle surfaces
              by protonated, positively charged phospholipases,
              electrostatically attracted to the negatively charged vesicles.
              Model experiments suggest that progressively accumulating
              cationic amphiphilic drugs inserting into the vesicle membrane
              with their hydrophobic molecular moieties disturb and attenuate
              the main mechanism of lipid degradation as discussed here. By
              compensating the negative surface charge, cationic enzymes are
              released from the surface of vesicles and proteolytically
              degraded, triggering a progressive lipid storage and the
              formation of inactive lamellar bodies.",

               information criterion (WAIC) are methods for estimating
               pointwise out-of-sample prediction accuracy from a fitted
               Bayesian model using the log-likelihood evaluated at the
               posterior simulations of the parameter values. LOO and WAIC have
               various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error
               such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they
               involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and
               stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using
               existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation
               of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new
               procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is
               asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is
               more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential
               observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain
               approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and
               for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We

               today's model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to
               perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated.

               interpretations in their own modeling work. The text presents
               generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian
               perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of
               Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the
               basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also
               discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process
               models for spatial and network autocorrelation. By using
               complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a
               practical foundation for performing statistical inference.
               Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the

                   Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to
                   specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us
                   with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and
                   using these models, along with many remaining challenges in
                   computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world
                   problems requires not only statistical skills, subject
                   matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the
                   decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these

               are simple and generally applicable to the output of any
               iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers
               primarily interested in the science underlying the data and

               interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative
               simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use
               several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from
               an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative
               simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest,
