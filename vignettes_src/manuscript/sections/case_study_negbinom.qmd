## Over dispersed negative binomial response

The response of an assay results from a measurement of the experimental system.
Often the measurements are normalized so that the response for negative control
is 1 (e.g. diseased) and the positive control is 0 (e.g. healthy). However when
the robustness of the measurement depends on the measured value, this
normalization can make it difficult to combine different measurements. An
alternative approach is to model the measurements directly, to take into account
the uncertainty associated with the response. To illustrate, if the measurement
is the relative number of cells having a phenotype, then five out of ten cells
and five thousand out of ten thousand cells will have the same response of 0.5,
but the former will a less reliable measurement.
