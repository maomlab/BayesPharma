               computing a posterior distribution, and Bayesian visualization
               is about more than trace plots of Markov chains. Practical
               Bayesian data analysis, like all data analysis, is an iterative
               process of model building, inference, model checking and
               evaluation, and model expansion. Visualization is helpful in
               each of these stages of the Bayesian workflow and it is
               indispensable when drawing inferences from the types of modern,
               high dimensional models that are used by applied researchers.",

                   integration to account for draws from the wrong
                   distribution, but the resulting estimate can be noisy when
                   the importance ratios have a heavy right tail. This
                   routinely occurs when there are aspects of the target
                   distribution that are not well captured by the approximating
                   distribution, in which case more stable estimates can be
                   obtained by modifying extreme importance ratios. We present
                   a new method for stabilizing importance weights using a
                   generalized Pareto distribution fit to the upper tail of the

                   way to handle uncertainty in all observations, model
                   parameters, and model structure using probability theory.
                   Probabilistic programming languages make it easier to
                   specify and fit Bayesian models, but this still leaves us
                   with many options regarding constructing, evaluating, and
                   using these models, along with many remaining challenges in
                   computation. Using Bayesian inference to solve real-world
                   problems requires not only statistical skills, subject
                   matter knowledge, and programming, but also awareness of the
                   decisions made in the process of data analysis. All of these
                   aspects can be understood as part of a tangled workflow of
                   applied Bayesian statistics. Beyond inference, the workflow
                   also includes iterative model building, model checking,
                   validation and troubleshooting of computational problems,
                   model understanding, and model comparison. We review all

                   fitting many models for any given problem, even if only a
                   subset of them will ultimately be relevant for our

               today's model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to
               perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated.
               This unique computational approach ensures that readers
               understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and
               interpretations in their own modeling work. The text presents
               generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian
               perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of
               Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the
               basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also
               discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process
               models for spatial and network autocorrelation. By using
               complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a
               practical foundation for performing statistical inference.
               Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the
               natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced
               or specialized statistical modeling. Web ResourceThe book is

              using the log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations
              of the parameter values. LOO and WAIC have various advantages
              over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC

              computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations
              for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation
              draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using
              Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for
              regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically
              equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the
              finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a
              byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate
              standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for
              comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement

              characterized by excessive accumulation of phospholipids. Its
              cellular mechanism is still not well understood, but it is known
              that cationic amphiphilic drugs can induce it. These drugs have a
              hydrophilic amine head group that can be protonated in the
              endolysosomal compartment. As cationic amphiphiles, they are
              trapped in lysosomes, where they interfere with negatively
              charged intralysosomal vesicles, the major platforms of cellular
              sphingolipid degradation. Metabolic principles observed in
              sphingolipid and phospholipid catabolism and inherited
              sphingolipidoses are of great importance for lysosomal function
              and physiological lipid turnover at large. Therefore, we also
              propose intralysosomal vesicles as major platforms for
              degradation of lipids and phospholipids reaching them by
              intracellular pathways like autophagy and endocytosis.
              Phospholipids are catabolized as components of vesicle surfaces
              by protonated, positively charged phospholipases,
              electrostatically attracted to the negatively charged vesicles.
              Model experiments suggest that progressively accumulating
              cationic amphiphilic drugs inserting into the vesicle membrane
              with their hydrophobic molecular moieties disturb and attenuate
              the main mechanism of lipid degradation as discussed here. By
              compensating the negative surface charge, cationic enzymes are
              released from the surface of vesicles and proteolytically
