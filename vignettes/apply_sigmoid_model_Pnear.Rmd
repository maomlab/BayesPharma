# Modeling Folding Funnels
A common task in molecular modeling is to predict the conformation of the folded
state for a given molecular system. For example, the Rosetta *ab initio*, or
protein-protein-interface docking protocols. To turn the simulation into a prediction
requires predicting the relative free energy of the folded state relative a reference.

The Rosetta score function can score individual conformations, but doesn't capture
the free energy of the state. Typically, a researcher will run a series of trajectories
and generate a **score vs. RMSD plot** and look for a "folding funnel" e.g. lower
energies for conformations that are closer to a target folded state. Here, RMSD
is the root-mean squared deviation measuring the euclidean distance of pairs of atom
defined by the application (for example just the backbone for sequence design or
interface atoms for docking).

## Pnear score
To quantify the quality of the folding funnel, recently, there has been interest
in using the **Pnear score**, which is defined by

    Pnear = Sum_i[exp(-RMSD[i]^2/lambda^2)*exp(-score[i]/k_BT)] /
            Sum_i[exp(-score[i]/k_BT)]

where *(RMSD[i], score[i])* is the score RMSD and score values for a
conformation *i*. The parameter *lambda* is measured in Angstroms indicating the
breadth of the Gaussian used to define "native-like-ness".  The bigger the
value, the more permissive the calculation is to structures that deviate from
native. Typical values for peptides range from 1.5 to 2.0, and for proteins from
2.0 to perhaps 4.0. And finally the parameter *k_BT* is measured in in energy
units, determines how large an energy gap must be in order for a sequence to be
said to favor the native state. The default value, 0.62, should correspond to
physiological temperature for ref2015 or any other scorefunction with units of
kcal/mol.

## Two state model
Thinking of the folded and unfolded states as a two-state model and RMSD as
a reaction coordinate or "collective variable", then the energy gap can be
modeled by a sigmoidal Boltzmann distribution.

For a principled molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulation that maintains
detailed balance, it is in theory possible to use thermodynamic integration to
quantify the energy gap between the two states. However, this is often not 
computationally feasible for proteins of moderate size or in a protein design or
screening context where many different molecules need to be evaluated given a
limited computational budget. So, Instead, we will assume that the at least
locally around the folded state, the degrees of freedom increase exponentially
so that the log of the RMSD defines a linear reaction coordinate. 

If we simulate, trajectory points from the sigmoid on the log(RMSD) scale,
with a Normally distributed error we can generate synthetic score-vs-rmsd plots

A nice thing about having the parametric model to generate score-vs-rmsd plots,
is that it allows us to measure measure the sensitivity of the Pnear to differently
shaped score-vs-rmsd plots. For example we can scan both the radius of

Another question we can use this model to investigate is how reproducible is the Pnear score?

# Antibody SnugDock Case study
As a case study, we can look at the real score-vs-rmsd plots from the Antibody
SnugDock scientific benchmark. It is evaluates the SnugDock protocol over 6
Antibody protein targets



We can use the fit the sigmoid model to the `log(RMSD)` using the
`BayesPharma` package, which relies on `BRMS` and `Stan`

## Quantify Pnear uncertainty
Using the two-state model fit, it is possible to propagate the posterior
uncertainty to estimate the uncertainty of the Pnear.
